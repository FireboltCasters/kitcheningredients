# Android

You will need:

- Gradle 6.9 (7 and newer does not work)
- Java v 15:

```
openjdk version "15" 2020-09-15
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 15+36-1562)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 15+36-1562, mixed mode, sharing)
```


## Troubleshooting

### major version 61

```
...
Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 7.0.
Use '--warning-mode all' to show the individual deprecation warnings.
See https://docs.gradle.org/6.9/userguide/command_line_interface.html#sec:command_line_warnings

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* Where:
Build file '.../app/node_modules/react-native-webview/android/build.gradle'

* What went wrong:
Could not compile build file '/Users/nbaumgartner/Documents/GitHub/RocketMealsApp/app/node_modules/react-native-webview/android/build.gradle'.
> startup failed:
  General error during semantic analysis: Unsupported class file major version 61
```

To solve this check if you are using java 15 (later versions will not work due to gradle)

Try in your browser the given urls (for example: https://jcenter.bintray.com/net/minidev/json-smart/maven-metadata.xml).
If these sites are also down, the external repository is down.
Add anohter repository to pull packages from in `build.gradle` (https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/94400)
